## Overview

This docs directory serves as the repository location for documentation and the extension's webview user interface source subtree. There are no files at the docs root; instead the directory contains a single subdirectory, webview-ui, which holds the webview UI layer and its source organization. At the top level of docs/webview-ui there are no root files; the actual webview source lives under a src/ subdirectory. The src/ directory contains three root-level source files that implement the webview frontend; one of those files is App.tsx, which is identified as the main UI entry point in the provided description.

Within this directory structure, documentation and UI implementation are separated: the docs directory is the container for explanatory and UI frontend artifacts, while the webview-ui subdirectory specifically groups the webview frontend source and styling. Developers looking to work on the extension's frontend should navigate into docs/webview-ui/src to find the primary UI source files (including App.tsx). This directory's role in the larger system is to collate the extension documentation and to host the webview frontend layer that will be integrated into the extension build elsewhere in the repository.


### File Organization

The docs directory contains no root files and is organized hierarchically: a webview-ui subdirectory holds the webview UI layer. Inside webview-ui the actual frontend source is placed under a src/ subdirectory (which contains three root-level source files, including App.tsx). This keeps documentation and UI source grouped and separates top-level docs from implementation details.

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 webview-ui](./webview-ui/README.md)

**Purpose:** Contains the extension's webview user interface source and styling, organized under a src/ subdirectory which holds the webview frontend files (including App.tsx as the main UI entry).

## Architecture Notes

- The webview frontend is isolated under docs/webview-ui and, more specifically, inside a src/ subdirectory to keep UI source and styling grouped separately from top-level documentation.
- App.tsx is designated as the main UI entry point within the webview frontend source files.
