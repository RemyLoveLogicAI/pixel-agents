## Overview

This directory holds the webview UI layer for the project. At the top level of docs/webview-ui there are no root files; the actual webview source lives in the src/ subdirectory. The src/ directory contains three root-level source files that implement the webview frontend: App.tsx (the main UI entry file for the webview UI), constants.ts (shared static values used by the webview UI), and index.css (global styles applied to the webview layer). Those files together form the single-entry webview UI surface and its styling.

The directory's role in the larger system is to encapsulate the extension's frontend code that will be rendered inside a webview. The src/ subdirectory groups the UI entry point, shared static values, and global styles so developers can quickly find the main entry (App.tsx), adjust reusable constants (constants.ts), or update global styling (index.css). This separation keeps the webview UI layer focused and isolated from other layers of the project while making it straightforward to locate the files needed to modify behavior or appearance of the webview UI.


### File Organization

All webview UI source is placed under the src/ subdirectory. The subdirectory contains the main UI entry (App.tsx), shared static values (constants.ts), and global styles (index.css). This keeps the top-level directory clean while grouping related UI files together for easier navigation and maintenance.

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 src](./src/README.md)

**Purpose:** Holds the webview UI source for the extension's frontend layer, including the main UI entry, shared constants, and styling for the webview UI.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| [src/constants.ts](../src/constants.ts.md) | Provides shared static values used by the webview UI and imported by App.tsx. |

## Architecture Notes

- The webview UI is organized into a single src/ subdirectory that contains the main entry, shared constants, and global styles to keep the UI layer cohesive and isolated.
- App.tsx functions as the single entry point for the webview UI, while constants.ts centralizes static values and index.css centralizes global styling.
