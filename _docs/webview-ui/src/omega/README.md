## Overview

This directory contains a root-level TypeScript constants file (constants.ts) and a subdirectory of UI components. The constants.ts file is intended to expose static values used by the omega portion of the webview UI; it serves as a single place to manage values that multiple components may consume. The components/ subdirectory holds eight TSX component files that implement distinct visual or control elements for the omega area.

Together, the root constants.ts and the components/ subdirectory form the implementation surface for the omega area of the webview UI. Components in components/ are expected to import shared values from constants.ts as needed. This structure separates static configuration (constants) from presentational and interactive code (TSX component files), making it easier to locate and update either constants or component implementations while keeping the omega-specific UI code isolated from other areas of the webview UI project.


### File Organization

Files are organized by feature: a single root constants.ts provides shared static values for this feature (omega), while a components/ subdirectory groups all visual/control TSX components that implement the omega UI. This keeps configuration and UI implementation co-located under the omega feature.

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 components](./components/README.md)

**Purpose:** Holds UI component source files (TSX) for the omega portion of the webview UI, each representing a distinct visual/control element used by the surrounding application.

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `components` | The components/ subdirectory contains the TSX component files that implement the omega UI and will import shared constants from constants.ts. |

## Architecture Notes

- Separation of concerns: static values are centralized in constants.ts while presentational and interactive code resides in components/ to keep configuration and UI logic distinct.
- Feature-scoped layout: this directory is organized per feature (omega) so all related constants and components are grouped together for easier maintenance.
