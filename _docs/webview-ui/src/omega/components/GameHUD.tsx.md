## Overview

This file exports a single presentational React functional component, GameHUD, typed to accept an OmegaSystemsState prop (types imported from ../hooks/useOmegaSystems.js). GameHUD performs pure calculations and renders several HUD sections: team level and an XP bar, a compact tier summary using TIER_CONFIGS, up to three active quests with per-quest progress bars, active mods with optional expiration countdowns, and a vertical stack of toast messages.

A small internal helper ToastItem({ toast }: { toast: ToastMessage }) computes a fade-out opacity from Date.now() - toast.timestamp (fully visible for 2000ms, then linearly fading over 1000ms). The component uses inline React.CSSProperties objects for styling and CSS transitions for animated widths and opacity. It is strictly presentational (no side effects or internal state); time-based values (toast opacity, mod remaining seconds) are recomputed on render, so a parent must re-render periodically for live countdowns.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

| Module | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| [../hooks/useOmegaSystems.js](../../hooks/useOmegaSystems.js.md) | Imports TypeScript types: OmegaSystemsState and ToastMessage. Used to type GameHUD props and ToastItem parameter. |
| [../constants.js](../../constants.js.md) | Imports TIER_CONFIGS used to look up display properties (color and emoji) for each TierLevel when rendering the tier summary. |
| [../types.js](../../types.js.md) | Imports the TierLevel type which is used to declare the fixed ordered list of tiers rendered. |

This file is part of the **components** directory. View the [directory index](_docs/webview-ui/src/omega/components/README.md) to see all files in this module.

## Architecture Notes

- Presentation-only React functional components: GameHUD and ToastItem accept typed props and produce UI without side effects or internal React state.
- Style approach: Inline React.CSSProperties constants and per-element inline style objects centralize styling and enable inline transitions.
- Rendering/data-flow: GameHUD derives display values (XP percentage, tier counts, quest progress, mod remaining seconds) from a parent-provided OmegaSystemsState; no internal memoization is used.

## Usage Examples

### Embedding GameHUD in a top-level UI with state from a hook

A parent component obtains an OmegaSystemsState (e.g., from useOmegaSystems) and renders <GameHUD state={state} />. GameHUD displays team level, XP bar, tier summary, active quests (up to three), active mods with optional remaining seconds, and fading toast messages computed from toast timestamps.

## Maintenance Notes

- Performance: Consider memoizing derived values (tier counts, filtered quests) for large lists to avoid repeated work on every render.
- Edge cases: Guard against quest.target === 0 when computing progress to avoid NaN/Infinity; xpForNext === 0 is already guarded.
- Testing: Cover xpForNext === 0, empty arrays, and mod.expiresAt values in the past and future.
- Behavioral caution: Top-level container sets pointerEvents: 'none' while panels set pointerEvents: 'auto' to allow click-through behavior; be careful when adding interactive controls.

## Functions and Classes


#### function ToastItem

![Type: Sync](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Sync-green)

### Signature

```typescript (tsx)
function ToastItem({ toast }: { toast: ToastMessage })
```

### Description

Implementation not visible

Implementation not visible

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `toast` | `ToastMessage` | ✅ | An object named 'toast' provided as a destructured prop; exact structure and usage are defined by the ToastMessage type but the implementation is not visible here.
 |

### Returns

**Type:** `unknown (implementation not visible)`

The function's return value cannot be determined because the function body is not available in the provided source excerpt.


### Usage Examples

#### Example call with a toast prop (implementation not visible so this is a syntactic usage example)

```typescript (tsx)
ToastItem({ toast })
```

Demonstrates calling the function/component with a destructured prop object containing 'toast'. The actual effect depends on the unseen implementation.

### Complexity

Unknown (implementation not visible)

### Notes

- Only the function signature line was provided. The implementation body is not included in the input, so behavior, return value, side effects, and internal calls cannot be determined without the full source.
