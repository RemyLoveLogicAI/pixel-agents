# 📁 components

> **Purpose:** Holds UI component source files (TSX) for the omega portion of the webview UI, each representing a distinct visual/control element used by the surrounding application.

## Overview

This directory contains eight TSX component files that make up the visual and interactive elements for the omega area of the webview UI. Each file listed at the root appears to be a separate component (based on the .tsx type) responsible for a specific portion of the UI; exact implementation details or internal responsibilities were not provided in the input. Where filenames are descriptive (for example DevToolsPanel.tsx or HeatmapOverlay.tsx), they indicate the intended UI area or control, but specific behavioral details are not available in the provided context.

Collectively these component files represent the building blocks for the omega UI surface: panels, overlays, charts, HUD elements, consoles, and view controls. The directory plays the role of grouping these UI elements together so they can be imported and composed by higher-level views or screens elsewhere in the codebase. Because no subdirectories were specified for this directory, the structure is a flat collection of component modules intended to be consumed by the surrounding system; precise inter-component relationships and data flows are not described in the provided information.


### File Organization

Files are organized at the root of this directory as individual TSX component modules. Each file represents a single component (naming reflects UI intent). The flat layout groups related UI components together for easy discovery and import; no hierarchical grouping or feature subfolders are present in the provided listing.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [DelegationCanvas.tsx](./DelegationCanvas.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |
| [DevToolsPanel.tsx](./DevToolsPanel.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |
| [GameHUD.tsx](./GameHUD.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |
| [HeatmapOverlay.tsx](./HeatmapOverlay.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `parent UI modules` | These components are intended to be imported and composed by higher-level UI views or the surrounding webview UI; exact import paths and consumers are outside this directory listing. |

## Architecture Notes

- Flat collection of independently named TSX component modules; no subdirectory grouping provided.
- Filenames indicate single-responsibility UI components (panels, overlays, views, controls), suggesting composition by parent views.
