## Overview

This directory contains TypeScript JSX (TSX) component files that implement individual visual elements used by the webview UI. At the root level there are two component files: AgentHierarchy.tsx and Scanlines.tsx. Each file is intended to define a single component (or related small set of components) that can be imported by higher-level views or pages.

There are no subdirectories in this folder. The directory is organized as a flat collection of component source files, so each file is a discrete UI unit meant to be composed by the surrounding webview layer. The role of this directory in the larger system is to centralize small, reusable TSX components so that view code elsewhere can import these visual building blocks without duplicating UI logic.


### File Organization

Files are organized flat at the directory root, with each TSX file representing a single UI component. This makes it easy to locate and import individual components; the flat layout is suitable when the number of components is small (two files here).

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [AgentHierarchy.tsx](./AgentHierarchy.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |
| [Scanlines.tsx](./Scanlines.tsx.md) | ⚛️ React |

## Architecture Notes

- This directory is a flat collection of TSX components intended to be imported by higher-level webview code. Keep components focused and small to maintain the flat structure.
