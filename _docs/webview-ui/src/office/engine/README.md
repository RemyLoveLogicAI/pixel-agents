## Overview

This directory holds engine-level source files for the office portion of the webview UI. At present it contains a single TypeScript file, characters.ts. The provided context did not include a detailed purpose for that file, so this README treats characters.ts as the sole artifact in this directory and notes that its specific responsibilities are not specified in the input.

Because there are no subdirectories listed, the directory is organized flat and intended to group engine-specific concerns related to the office feature. The directory's role in the larger system is to house engine source artifacts for the office UI area; developers should inspect characters.ts to determine the exact runtime responsibilities, data structures, or logic it contains. If additional engine files are added, they should be placed alongside characters.ts and documented here.


### File Organization

All files for the engine layer live at this directory root. Currently there is a single file (characters.ts). New engine-related TypeScript files should follow the same placement and naming conventions to keep the directory simple and discoverable.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [characters.ts](./characters.ts.md) | 📘 TypeScript |

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown` | No dependency information provided in the context; inspect characters.ts to identify internal or external module usage. |

## Architecture Notes

- Directory currently uses a flat organization with a single engine-level TypeScript file. If more engine files are added, consider grouping by feature or splitting into subdirectories to maintain clarity.
