## Overview

This directory contains the TypeScript type declarations at the root and an engine subdirectory that currently holds engine-level character-related TypeScript source. At the root level there is a single file, types.ts, which provides type definitions for the office portion of the webview UI. The provided context does not give details of the exact types declared, so this README treats types.ts as the primary root artifact that other parts of the office module will import for static typing and interfaces.

The engine/ subdirectory contains engine-level code for the office module and currently hosts a single file (characters.ts) that is intended for character-related logic used by the engine layer. Together, the root-level types and the engine source comprise the office area of the webview UI: types.ts supplies shared type information, while engine/ contains implementation-level code that relies on those types. This directory plays the role of grouping office-specific typing and engine artifacts so other UI or engine layers can import a consistent set of types and engine utilities for office features.


### File Organization

Files are organized with a small root containing shared type declarations (types.ts) and a distinct engine/ subdirectory for engine-level implementation. This separation keeps type definitions centralized while implementation details live in a dedicated engine layer.

## 📂 Subdirectories

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

### [📁 engine](./engine/README.md)

**Purpose:** Contains engine-level code for the office module; currently hosts character-related TypeScript source used by the engine layer.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| [engine/characters.ts](../engine/characters.ts.md) | Engine-level implementation that likely imports types from types.ts for character-related logic. |

## Architecture Notes

- Root-level types.ts centralizes type declarations for the office module while engine/ holds implementation code, enforcing a separation between typing and engine logic.
- Current structure is minimal: one root file and a single engine submodule, which simplifies navigation but suggests expansion should follow the existing layer separation.
