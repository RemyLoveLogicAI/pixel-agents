## Overview

This directory contains hook-level code for the webview UI portion of the project. At the root there is a single TypeScript file, useExtensionMessages.ts, which is intended to provide hook logic related to extension message handling for the webview UI. The exact implementation details are contained within that file.

The directory is deliberately small and focused: it groups hook implementations used by UI components in one place to make them easy to discover and reuse. Because there are no subdirectories listed, the structure is flat and each hook file at the root represents a reusable piece of stateful logic for the webview UI. Refer to the individual file(s) for implementation and usage details.


### File Organization

Files are organized flat at the root of this directory, each file expected to export one or more hooks for use by webview UI components. The single file present groups extension-message-related hook logic in one place for discoverability.

## 📂 All Files

| File | Type |
| --- | --- |
| [useExtensionMessages.ts](./useExtensionMessages.ts.md) | 📘 TypeScript |

## Architecture Notes

- Directory is a focused location for webview UI hooks; keep files single-purpose and named with the 'use' prefix.
- Because this directory currently contains a single file, prefer keeping hook implementations co-located here rather than scattering across components.
